To run this simulation, you need gnuplot and g++. Simply run the 
Simulation.sh script with giving an argument for the run number.
For example, running it as:
sh ./Simulation.sh 104
will run the simulation based on the paramters in Program/main.cpp,
and will output the results into a folder named Run104.
