To run this simulation, you need gnuplot and g++. Simply run the 
Simulation.sh script with giving an argument for the run number.
For example, running it as:
sh ./Simulation.sh 104
will run the simulation based on the paramters in Program/main.cpp,
and will output the results into a folder named Run104.

Note: Depending on your version of Gnuplot, the plotting scripts may
not work. If they don't, please just comment them out of the 
Simulation.sh script.
